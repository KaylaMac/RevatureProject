# RevatureProject
The objective of this project was to develop a website for a fictional food delivery service named Foodar. With this website, users would have the option of creating an account with Foodar and making a delivery request. 
## index.html
This is the homepage of the site. On this page, users may type in their zip code to see if they can use Foodar. Once the user types in their zip code and clicks on the “Go!” button, a message will be displayed indicating that they can or cannot use the service. Since the service is fictional, the only condition that would determine the message is whether or not the zip code is a number above 20,000.     
## request.html
This page displays the user’s total prior to them confirming their request. The base price is determined by the “style” that they choose and once they select how much they would like to tip, the percentage of the base price is calculated and added to the total.    
## register.html
This is where the user would input their information to use Foodar. Nothing is done with the information as the service does not exist.
